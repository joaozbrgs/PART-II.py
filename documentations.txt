This will work for me as the README file.

Fisrt thig we need to understand are the ways to handle data in python and compound variables
tuple, list, dictionary

tuples'()': are imutable. You cannot change the values within it while running the program. 
Ideal to store and keep data, it will not change.

list '[]': can be modified.
